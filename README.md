# 🖼️ Image SEO Optimizer

This project is a simple Python tool to help e-commerce store owners automatically optimize image file names and generate alt-text for better SEO performance.

### 🚀 Features
- Automatically renames images based on a list of product keywords
- Generates descriptive alt-text for each image
- Outputs metadata into a `.csv` file
- Designed for e-commerce use cases (e.g., Shopify stores)

### 🛠️ How It Works
1. Place your product images in a folder (e.g., `images/`)
2. Provide a list of product keywords in a `.csv` file
3. Run the notebook to:
   - Rename images for SEO
   - Create alt-text
   - Export a report with all SEO-optimized data

### 📁 Files
- `image_seo_optimizer.ipynb` — Main Python notebook
- `product_keywords.csv` — Sample product names
- `README.md` — You're reading it :)

### 📌 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `pandas`, `os`, `uuid`, `re`

### 🧠 Future Enhancements
- Use AI/ML (like GPT or spaCy) to generate more human-like alt-text
- Add GUI for non-tech users
